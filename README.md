# Deep Learning Tutorials

This repository contains my tutorials from the **Deep Learning** module at IIT Sri Lanka, affiliated with Robert Gordon University (UK).

Each notebook reflects topics covered during the semester, including:
- Backpropagation with NumPy
- Neural recommender systems
- Word embeddings and classification
- Sequence-to-sequence translation
- TensorBoard visualizations and more

These materials were created as part of my academic journey and are intended for learning and reference.
